                                    <p>Mike has been by Albert's side through the tumult and trials of life – filling in Blank Spaces and Shaking it Off – all while sharing tales of love, loss, and gravitational waves over way-too-late bottles of wine and an in-apartment whiteboard.</p></div>

                                    <p>David has subjected Brett to his friendship for nearly ten years and shows no signs of stopping. Even after all this time, they still find ways to become completely incomprehensible and crack each other up.</p></div>

                                    <p>Anna and Albert have stayed close ever since they met at summer camp in the nineties. Bonding as Taiwanese-Americans and Californian-East Coasters, they've always been there for each other, especially when they're a bit out of place.</p></div>

                                    <p>Brett’s time in DC is framed and defined by his friendship with Ralph. The two met as chorus buddies, and they’ve grown together in remarkable ways that they never would have predicted when they were just two young, chaotic baritones giggling in the back of rehearsal.</p></div>

                                    <p>Morgan's presence in Albert's life has seemed eternal, from the early days of the DC LGBT climbing group to the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington to the fated costume party where he introduced Brett and Albert.</p></div>

                                    <p>Tristan is a classic. He and Brett have shared countless cooking nights, movie marathons, and all manner of creature comforts. He can always be depended on for a clever quip or a prolonged battle of wits (“The English majors are at it again,” as Albert would say).</p></div>

                                    <p>Eileen and Albert have shared every one of their lives' milestones. They're constantly comparing notes on everything, sharing their lived experiences as only siblings can.</p></div>

                                    <p>Kate met Brett at UNC Chapel Hill as they were both taking their first proper steps into the world as adults. These two have seen each other through some of the most ridiculous adventures college kids and post-graduates can find, and their timeless bond is built on nearly two decades of friendship and admiration.</p></div>
